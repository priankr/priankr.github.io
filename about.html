										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										I'm a professional working in project management and consulting, with a passion for solving complex challenges using data and technology.   
										<br><br>
										I am originally from India but I have lived in the United States, Nigeria and Trinidad & Tobago as well for several years. Currently, I am working on remote projects and spending most of my time learning various data science and analytics tools and techniques. Overall, working on building a broad portfolio of technical skills and business knowledge because I am immensely interested in data driven business and operations strategy.
										<br><br>
										My long term goal is to be at the helm of designing and implementing operating models for businesses; ideally for a company that is harnessing technology in some exciting and impactful way. 
										</p>
										<h3 class="major">How I Got Interested in Data</h3>
										<p>
											For almost three years now, I have been working on projects while partnering with an experienced independent Data Science and IT consultant. My work involves a combination of market research, business analysis, operations research and strategy. A lot of my experience is in analyzing how companies in different industry segments can effectively deliver the greatest value to their customers through their products and services. I got interested in data-driven decision making and how data analytics could be leveraged to help understand things like market demand, user behavior, patterns and relationships between variables.   
											<br><br>
											Over the last year and a half I have been learning about various data science and analytics tools and techniques, exploring how data analysts and data scientists explore and analyze data to answer questions, and learning how to combine observations with context to provide valuable, meaningful insights. Join me as I continue to learn and build my skills! 
										</p>
										<h3 class="major">Areas of Interest</h3>
										<p>Primarily interested in exploring how complex customer, business and market challenges can be solved using data. Specifically exploring the following areas:</p>
										<ul class="alt">
											<li><b>Prescriptive Analytics</b>: Using data to help make decisions</li>
											<li><b>Descriptive Analytics</b>: Using data to evaluate present situation</li>
											<li><b>Predictive Models</b>: Using machine learning to predict outcomes</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Take a look at my work on my projects page! Additional details about my work experience and these projects can be found on my LinkedIn, Github and Kaggle accounts.</p>
